# Reproducibility

## Environment
- Create env:
  micromamba env create -f environment/environment.yml
- Activate:
  micromamba activate geo

## Run pipeline
python scripts/01_download.py
python scripts/02_clean.py
python scripts/03_analysis.py
python scripts/04_webmap.py

## Notes
- Distances/areas must be computed in a projected CRS (meters), not EPSG:4326.
- Always check CRS, geometry validity, missing values and outliers.

### Data management for reproducibility
- Raw InsideAirbnb files (e.g., `calendar.csv`, `reviews.csv`, `listings.csv`) are not tracked in git due to size/licensing; place them locally in `data/original/`.
- The project is fully reproducible: all processed datasets in `data/processed/` can be regenerated by running the pipeline scripts/notebooks.
- Small web-ready artifacts (e.g., `data/processed/neighbourhoods_enriched.geojson` and `data/processed/listings_points_enriched_sample.geojson`) may be tracked to support fast webmap rendering.
- Final report figures are stored in `reports/figures/`.
